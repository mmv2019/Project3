# Aws Services 
## In this project we basically used 3 main services:
- Elastic Beanstalk
- RDS (relational database)
- S3 (simple storage service)

### Elastic Beanstalk :
#### we used Elastic Beanstalk to deploy our api and made sure that its health is ok and everything running smoothly.

### RDS :
#### we used RDS service to restore the data from one api after we linked the database with the api.

### S3 :
#### In order to deploy our front end we need to upload it to an S3 bucket and we linked the api with the frontend.
